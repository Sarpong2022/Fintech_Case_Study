#Introduction

Credit affects everything in todays society. Whether we want to buy a house, a new car or just to take out a loan for a renovation. You can have the cash for something and make an outright purchase but to create wealth you can leverage through credit. In the western world credit is King. That ios why businesses such as Experian and TransUnion are used in man organizations to determine whether an individual is eligible to recieve a loan or not. The problem is many people do not regularly check there credit. Your credit bulds trust between the individual and the lender. 
One of the main reasons is people do noit see the value opf checking until they get oldewr and the other reason is because people see it as a n unesscessary expense. 
One company wanted to change that perception and that companu is Credit Karma.

#Background

#The Credit Karma App

Due to the impact of technology and the amount of informationwe are exposed to peoples attention spans is approximately 20 seconds and thern our mind focuses on something else. Personally for me i would say mine is 10 seconds unless i tell myself to focus before doing a task. This is why i feel like the credit karma app is so important. The appearance and accessibility to the appl;ication in the app is certainly ahead of the competition. It shows the chances of your approval, how you could find financial help, and even a tax service which they could expand upon. The colours used are also very appealing to the new customer and the 20-35 target market. According to 'Mobile App Daily' the app the positives of the app is that it is free, pefrectly states the criteria for the credit score. The consd stated are that its unavailable in many countries and the finace product recommendations can be distractinbg. It also states that you cannot import transactions which could be frustrating for people who want there score to be improved. According to the PennyHoarder firms such as Credit Karmna, Experian, MoneyLion, GrowCredit, Self, Kickoff are credit building apps used to make consumers more attractive to loan providers. High interest rates have caused people to take out further loans to cover old loans and therefore delay retirement for former students and therir parents who were guarantor for these loans. 

#Lending 

Lending is centred about fast decision making. This was basically the first type of fintech. Lending has definately diversified into different spheres especially with companies like OnDeck. Point of Sale financing companies such as Affirm and Bread have also come to the forefront.Accoding to an article on mckinsey.com titled 'Scanning the fintech landscape'a new type of funding has taken over for small business. These companies are led by Kabbage and Funding Circle.
Bluevine and Fundbox are known to focus on credit cards using a variety of techniques in fintech known as verticle lending. 
Companies such as Tala and Branch use mobile phones to assess to microlend in developing countries. They make real time underwwriting decisions using this service.
Fortune.com states that 23% of the 23 million of americans in debt are over 45. This is astoiunding information and shows the debt burden on americans. This shows the importance of the fintech industry and how much of a part it has to play in helping consumers and reducing the stress in society. 
According to Business Matters UKs leading credit magazine 'Ziad El Baba, of Credit Karma, said Until buy now, pay later is fully regulated and incorporated into all credit reporting, consumers should be aware they wonâ€™t be recognised as credit-responsible for using these methods of borrowing, as they are for using overdrafts and credit cards. Today people do noit even remember what theyb owe and instead are prompted only when it has been reported to a credit agency. This is a big problem in society which is affecting even the middle class let alone the lower income classes.

#Issues in the Credit Agency Industry

A CNET report on August 8 2022, stated that some credit reporting agencies which include equifax and transunion had reported incorreect credit scores which affected those weho wanted loans getting denied. This is a problem because many people depend on these scores, and peoples mortgages are affected by these scores.
According to The Times Online these agencies are meant to help but they are instead 'Firms that offer credit checks are making millions of pounds by promoting credit cards and loans to hard-up borrowers worried about their finances'. This is a massive problem in the industry and it will take a culture chantge in the industry to remebver what is important regarding consumer protection. Accoring toi a report on the Insider, A survey of 1,022 Americans ages 18 to 25 from June 10 to June 15 from Credit Karma, first reported on by the New York Times, found that 29% of Gen Zers are living at home with parents or other relatives. This is a issue that needs to be addressed because it allows people who lack financial literacy to continue a cycle of debt which society needs to address. Credit Karma, according to the website 'The Drum' are now using Man City soccer star Kevin De Bruynne to lead there marketing campaign to get people to come on credit Karma. So to the public you would think that they want to help people improve credit but the company is funded by people clicking on the links of loans etc. So are they helping consumers or drowning the consumers by gettiung them in further debt ?

#Conclusion

I personally realize that a lot of these new companies are focusing on the unbanked world and those who do not have a lot of these financial services avaialable tot them. I feel like the new lending companies and fintech startt ups should expose them selves to certain cultures before they assume that these countries would adopt there products. It is essential for CEOs to put them self around people of various backgrounds to get an understanding of what there wants and needs are. Lending has people nd families in difficult decisions without caring aboout whether they can afford these products. So my hope is for the companies to care about helping the people instead of exploiting the people. Credit Karma could also find ways to make sure that the scores are accurate to increase a report with those who use there service. If you keep a relationship with your clients you are more likely to give accurate rerports. That reiterates my view of helping the consumer iunstead of focusing on the profits. 

#Recommendations

Credit Karma is a company with an even brighter fututre. I hope they assess each business they are advertising products for on their website to see if there business models rewflect helping the consumer. It is easy for a firm to be swayed towards making morer money than helping the people. Blockchain is a game changer. It Credit Karma incorporate blockhain and its uses to improve its infastreucture then it can contiunue to make a big impact. Companies such as BlockStrem and Consensys are companies who are taking advantage of this but many companies are not. Instead of waiting to see what happens its best for them to be proactive.
