#Introduction

Credit affects everything in todays society. Whether we want to buy a house, a new car or just to take out a loan for a renovation. You can have the cash for something and make an outright purchase but to create wealth you can leverage through credit. In the western world credit is King. That ios why businesses such as Experian and TransUnion are used in man organizations to determine whether an individual is eligle to recieve a loan or not. The problem is many people do not regularly check there credit.
One of the main reasons is people do noit see the value opf checking until they get oldewr and the other reason is because people see it as a n unesscessary expense. 
One company wanted to change that perception and that companu is Credit Karma.

#Lending 

Lending is centred about fast decision making. This was basically the first type of fintech. Lending has definately diversified into different spheres especially with companies like OnDeck. Point of Sale financing companies such as Affirm and Bread have also come to the forefront.Accoding to an article on mckinsey.com titled 'Scanning the fintech landscape'a new type of funding has taken over for small business. These companies are led by Kabbage and Funding Circle.
Bluevine and Fundbox are known to focus on credit cards using a variety of techniques in fintech known as verticle lending. 
Companies such as Tala and Branch use mobile phones to assess to microlend in developing countries. They make real time underwwriting decisions using this service.

#Conclusion

I personally realize that a lot of these new companies are focusing on the unbanked world and those who do not have a lot of these financial services avaialable tot them. I feel like the new lending companies and fintech startt ups should expose them selves to certain cultures before they assume that these countries would adopt there products. It is essential for CEOs to put them self around people of various backgrounds to get an understanding of what there wants and needs are. Lending has people nd families in difficult decisions without caring aboout whether they can afford these products. So my hope is for the companies to care about helping the people instead of exploiting the people.

#Recommendations

Credit Karma is a company with an even brighter fututre. I hope they assess each business they are advertising products for on their website to see if there business models rewflect helping the consumer. It is easy for a firm to be swayed towards making morer money than helping the people. Blockchain is a game changer. It Credit Karma incorporate blockhain and its uses to improve its infastreucture then it can contiunue to make a big impact. Companies such as BlockStrem and Consensys are companies who are taking advantage of this but many companies are not. Instead of waiting to see what happens its best for them to be proactive.
